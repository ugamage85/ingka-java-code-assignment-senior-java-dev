# Briefing

This application is a very simplified implementation of a Warehouse colocation management system.

Basically, we have 4 entities:
* `Location` represents a geographical place, a city
* `Store` represents a physical store, where `Products` are stored and sold
* `Warehouse` represents a place where `Products` are kept to eventually be distributed to the `Store`
* `Product` represent the goods actually sold to customers in the `Store`

This system is focused on the Warehouse and Store unit creation and management. So, this is not related to the internal operations of each, but, rather, to the basic creation and management of those and some operations related to how they relate to each other.

```
The implementation tasks for you to tackle can be [located at CODE_ASSINGMENT.md](CODE_ASSIGNMENT.md)
```

Besides the regular register (CRUD) operations, a `Warehouse` also has a special operation called "replace", where the company is creating a new Warehouse in the same area of an already existent one and we will deprecate this one, re-using the Business Unit Code that identifies every Warehouse to this new one. So, when a Warehouse is replaced we basically archive the current Warehouse using the Business Unit Code provided and create the Warehouse using this same Business Unit Code. This way we have a history track of the area/business unit.
